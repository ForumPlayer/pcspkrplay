PC Speaker Player

1. Introduction

This program will play PC speaker music in Linux using the Linux input devices API.  Currently 
loosely based on Megazeux style play statements, but might break on some less compliant play 
strings.

2. Compiling it

Executing:
make

should build it for you.  This doesn't depend on anything special that wouldn't come with linux.

3. Usage

<name or path to executable> <path to event device> <music string>

Example: ./pcspkrplay /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr icdefgab+cdefgab+c

You must have permission to access /dev/input/by-path/platform-pcspkr-event-spkr, which is 
usually a symbolic link set up by udev.  This might change some time in the future.  The pcspkr 
driver will also have to have been loaded for this device to appear.  Currently, that's loaded in 
with executing as root:
modprobe pcspkr

4. Megazeux format music strings

C, D, E, F, G, A, B  -  Play a note
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  -  Select octave, default 3
#, $  -  Placed after a note, moves the note up or down a semitone.  B# is accepted and becomes C on the next octave 
	except for 6B#, E becomes F, C$ becomes B on the previous octave except for 0C$.
Z, T, S, I, Q, W, H  -  Select note duration, 64th, 32nd, 16th, 8th, quarter, half, whole.  
	Default is 32nd.
+, -  -  Increase or decrease octave by 1, clips at 0 and 6.
.  -  Change duration of folloing notes by 150%.  Can be unset with another '.', can override 
'!'.
!  -  Change duration of following notes by 1/3.  Can be unset with another '!', can override 
'.'.
&string&  -  Ignores string.  Normally used to play a sample, but for this program, you can use 
	it for comments.
