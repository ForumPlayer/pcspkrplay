PC Speaker Player

1. Introduction

This program will play PC speaker music in Linux using the Linux input devices API.  Currently it only supports 
Megazeux style play statements.  ZZT #play statement support may be added later.

2. Compiling it

Executing:
sh build.sh

should build it for you.  This doesn't depend on anything special that wouldn't come with linux.

3. Usage

<name or path to executable> <path to event device> <music string>

Example: ./pcspkrplay /dev/input/event2 icdefgab+cdefgab

You must have permission to access /dev/input/event2.

4. Megazeux format music strings
